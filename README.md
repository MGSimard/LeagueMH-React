## About The Project

A recreation of my vanilla LoLCBL project, minus the CBL part, in React. Its only purpose is to fetch match histories of players across all League of Legends regions with public APIs. This project acts as practice with React, queries, and dynamic cdn asset fetching.

### Built With

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
- [AccountV1, SummonerV4, LeagueV4, MatchV5 & SummonerV4 Riot APIs](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis)
- [DataDragon](https://riot-api-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ddragon.html)
- [CommunityDragon](https://www.communitydragon.org/)

## Usage

As per the example on the app's landing page; select a region, enter a summoner name & tag then click fetch.
